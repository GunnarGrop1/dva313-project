# DVA313 Project - a cloud-native performance monitoring system
This program is a monitoring system for virtual machines running on Amazon Web Services.
The aim of the project is to offer an easy way of monitoring resource usage for you machines from an easy to use graphical dashboard.

## Amazon Web Services
For this program to do anything useful you will need an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account with an [EC2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2) instance running.
Once you have an EC2 instance running, go do the the [IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) panel, and create a an IAM account.
Give the new IAM user programmatic access, and give it the "CloudWatchFullAccess" right. REMEMBER to keep the secret key, as you will need it later. Go to the priviliges section and grant your new user full CloudWatch rights.

## Installation

### Ubuntu 20.04
PLEASE only install this on a new virtual machine, and not on your personal system.

Download the dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install apache2 php php-mysqli php-xml php-mbstring mariadb-server npm git
```

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GunnarGrop1/dva313-project.git
```

The install script will ask you to enter you AWS IAM Key, Secret Key, and the instance-id of the EC2 instance you want to monitor,
so make sure to have those handy
Run the install script (it will ask you for sudo priviliges):
```bash
cd dva313-project/
./install
```

One the install has finished, you can start to application with the 'run' file that was generated by the install:
```bash
./run
```

#### Troubleshooting

##### Can't run the install script
Make sure that the script is executable.
```bash
chmod +x install
```

##### Can't install dependencies
Make sure your system is up to date.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Windows 10
Setting everything up on Windows 10 must be done manually, and requires some work.
First of all make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) installed.

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/GunnarGrop1/dva313-project.git
```

Create a file called "credentials.php" in "dva313-project/backend/src", make sure it looks like this:
```php
<?php
$credentials_Key = '*your IAM access key*';
$credentials_Secret = '*your IAM secret key*';
$instance_id = '*your EC2 instance id"*';
?>
```

Setting up the web server:
```
1. Start XAMPP.
2. Press 'Explorer' on the right hand side of the XAMPP control panel.
3. Navigate to the "htdocs" folder, and create a new folder called "dva313".
4. In another window, navigate to the "dva313-project" folder that you cloned previously.
5. Copy the folder "dva313/backend" into "htdocs/dva313".
6. In the XAMPP control panel, click the "Start" action under the "Apache" module.
7. Done.
```

Setting up the database:
```
1. In the XAMPP control panel, click the "Start" action under the "MySQL" module.
2. Click the "Admin" action under the "MySQL" module. This will take you to a website.
3. On the website, click on the "SQL" tab at the top
4. In the SQL query box, paste this text "CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'dva313'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '';
 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dva313'@'%';
 FLUSH PRIVILEGES;".
5. Click "Go" in the bottom right. This will create a new MySQL user called "dva313".
6. Click on the "Databases" tab at the top.
7. Create a new database called "cloudnative".
8. Navigate to the "SQL" tab at the top, again.
9. Open up the "cloudnative.sql" in the project root directory in you favorite text editor and copy the content.
10. Paste the content into the SQL query box.
11. Click "Go" in the bottom right, again.
12. Done.
```

Install the npm dependencies:
```
1. Open up cmd.exe or PowerShell and navigat to the "dva313/dashboard" folder.
2. Run "npm install" and wait for it to finish.
3. Run "npm start" to start the application.
4. Everything's done!
```

#### Troubleshooting

##### The graphs on the dashboard doesn't load
Make sure that the "credentials.php" file you created earlier isn't actually called "credentials.php.txt". By default, Windows doesn't let you see file endings, and will append ".txt" to files it considers text files.
Also make sure that the you change the "xampp/htdocs/dva313/backend/src/credentials.php" file, if this is the problem.
